## Sponsors

Sponsorship helps keep NLP-OSS sustainable to widest possible audience. The NLP-OSS workshop is organized by volunteers from both academia and industry. Sponsorship goes to covering the cost of invited speakers. 

If you or your company or institution are interested in sponsoring the NLP-OSS, please send us an email at nlposs.workshop@gmail.com.
