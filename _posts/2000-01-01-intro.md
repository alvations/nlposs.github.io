## Workshop for Natural Language Processing Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)

With great scientific breakthrough comes solid engineering. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has benefited greatly from the open culture in sharing knowledge, data, and software. The primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing, and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. Our secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software collaborations and comparisons.

We refer to Natural Language Processing OSS as an umbrella term that not only covers traditional syntactic, semantic, phonetic, and pragmatic applications; we extend the definition to include
task-specific applications (e.g., machine translation, information retrieval, question-answering systems),
low-level string processing that contains valid linguistic information (e.g. unicode creation for new languages, language-based character set definitions) and
machine learning / artificial intelligence frameworks with functionalities focusing on text applications.

There are many workshops focusing open language resource/annotation creation and curation (e.g. BUCC, WAC, LOD, GWN, LAW). Moreover, we have the flagship LREC conference dedicated to linguistic resources. However, the engineering aspects of NLP OSS is overlooked and under-discussed within the community. To our best knowledge, this is the first workshop proposal that focuses more on the building aspect of NLP and lesser so on scientific novelty or state-of-art development.

More often than not, NLP OSS developers/users interact in silos communities within the ecologies of their respective projects. In the earlier days of NLP, linguistic software was often monolithic and the learning curve to install, use, and extend the tools was steep and frustrating.

With the advent of cross programming-language support for NLP and high-level languages like Python, R, Ruby, and Julia, we are starting to see the synergies between cross-community support across NLP OSS.

One classic example is NLTKâ€™s support for Stanford NLP tools which provides a Pythonic interface to the Stanford tools written in Java. More recently, the REST-ful API from Stanford CoreNLP tools has alleviated a host of issues that are related to cross OSS interfaces in NLTK. The developers have also interacted across their respective code repositories to raise issues and give code reviews (c.f. https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/1249 ).  Beyond the diamond sharpening effect of cross-OSS collaborations, the result of the successful interface between the tools opens door to easily benchmark annotations created by NLTK and Stanford CoreNLP.

Another example of precious OSS knowledge comes from SpaCy developer, where Montani (2017, https://ines.io/blog/spacy-commercial-open-source-nlp) shared her thoughts and challenges of commercial NLP OSS.  

We hope that our NLP-OSS workshop becomes the intellectual forum to collate this type of knowledge, announce new software/features, promote the open source culture and best practices that go beyond the conferences.
