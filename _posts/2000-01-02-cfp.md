## Workshop Structure

   To promote closer interaction, all accepted publications will be presented in the poster format and be required to give a 1 slide (90 seconds?) introduction of their work at the beginning of the session. For the rest of the workshop, invited talks will be given by developers and maintainers of prominent NLP OSS projects and we plan to close the workshop with a panel session with the invited speakers and the audience of the workshop.
